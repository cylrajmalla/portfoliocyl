"Pain itself is important to the main adipisicing elite." But before the pain, the lion's tincidunt is effective, the time of the feast."

## Good habits

1. Code with Intent, Not Just Speed

    Plan before typing: Sketch architecture, DB models, or user flows first.

    Avoid "just fix it" hacks: Write maintainable code, even if it takes 10% longer.

> “Everybody should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think.”

2. Master the Art of Deep Work

    Block distractions: Use tools like Focus Mode (VS Code), Cold Turkey, or Pomodoro timers.

    Batch tasks: Group meetings/code reviews to preserve flow state.
> “Productivity isn’t about grinding, it’s about consistency, clarity, and cutting waste”
